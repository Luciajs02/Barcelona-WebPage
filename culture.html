                    <h2>Architecture</h2>
                    <p>The Gothic Quarter is Barcelona's historic center with medieval and Roman-era buildings. Catalan Modernisme, similar to Art Nouveau, thrived from 1885 to 1950, featuring works by Antoni Gaudí like the Sagrada Família. Barcelona's urban expansion in the early 20th century showcased architects like Lluís Domènech i Montaner and Josep Puig i Cadafalch. The city also saw contributions from Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe at the 1929 World Exposition. Post-1992 Olympics, Barcelona became known for avant-garde architecture with landmarks such as the Hotel Arts and Torre Agbar.</p>

                    <p>The Filmoteca de Catalunya is Catalonia's central film archive, with a library and projection rooms. Its old location at Avinguda de Sarrià, in Eixample, was replaced by a new building in El Raval during early 2011 which includes a specialized library for film researchers.</p>

                    <h2>Easter Mona</h2>
                    <p>In the days leading up to Holy Week, the bakeries of Catalonia prepare a tasty and original spectacle: the Easter Mona, composed of cake and chocolate figurines; some with so much detail and complexity that they could easily pass as works of art.
                        The etymology of the word suggests that it could derive from the Arabic term “munna,” which means “provision of the mouth,” referring to the days in which the Moors paid the lease on their lands through cakes, produce, and hard-boiled eggs.
                        Later on, the Christian faith adapted these customs, and in the Catholic tradition, the godfather gives the Mona to his godson on Easter Sunday, while the day it should be enjoyed is actually Easter Monday. 
                        Today, Monas are made with cakes, butter, and chocolate, and adorned with feathers, candied fruits, eggs, or chocolate figurines.</p>

                    <h2>Castellers</h2>
                    <p>Castells are human towers, expressing the synthesis of physical strength and balance. Each tower is composed of three parts: the base, or pinya; the trunk, which is built upon the base; and the topmost part, typically featuring the youngest participants. Castells are measured by the number of “levels” of its trunk, and the number of participants at each level.
                        Every year, Barcelona’s biggest castellers activities are held at the Plaça Sant Jaume, where multiple groups gather to celebrate the Festival of the Mercè or Santa Eulàlia, one of the city’s patron saints. </p>

                    <p>That playful taunt, compelling a friendly Uncle to “drop” sweets rather than sardines, is told every Christmas to the Tió de Nadal, personified as a smiling log sporting a traditional hat of the region. In the days leading up to Christmas, he visits homes, where children get to feed him with various snacks until Christmas Day. Then, the log covers himself with a blanket, and children beat him with sticks while singing popular holiday songs. This is all in hopes that the Tió “drops” a great bounty of gifts; typically candies, sweets, or chocolates.</p><br>
